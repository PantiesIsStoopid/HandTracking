# Hand Gesture Finger Counter

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and count the number of fingers raised in real-time. It captures video from a webcam, processes the frames to detect hands, and counts the number of fingers that are raised. The result is displayed on the video feed, showing the number of fingers detected for each hand.
